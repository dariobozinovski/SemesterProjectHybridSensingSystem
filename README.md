in this repo there is all the codebase of the semester project Obstacle detection for hybrid under/above-water crawler for ship hull cleaning
there are 3 main elements:
the openecho folder containing the arduino code to use theopensource hardware. 
PCB_code are all the snippets of code used for testing the sensor and especially the PCB_continous_readings is the final code uploaded on the custom pcb to collect and stream the data.
PCB visualizer create the visual user graphinc interface form the streamed data.
