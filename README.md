# SemesterProjectHybridSensingSystem
in this repo there is all the codebase of the semester project Obstacle detection for hybrid under/above-water crawler for ship hull cleaning
there are 3 main elements:
the openecho folder containing the arduino code to use theopensource hardware. 
PCB_code are all the snippets of code used for testing the sensor and especially the PCB_continous_readings is the final code uploaded on the custom pcb to collect and stream the data.
PCB visualizer create the visual user graphinc interface form the streamed data.

all the hardware design can be found on Onshape:
